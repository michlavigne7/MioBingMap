# MioBingMap
Show multiple routes with multiple stops for a variety of drivers

Download the demo file if you want to take a look at the product when it was close to be done :)

All the data were coming from my database : Adress, driver names, all info from the treeview etc...

The datepicker changes the selected date to see the routes from another day.

Checkboxes removes or show selected driver routes.
